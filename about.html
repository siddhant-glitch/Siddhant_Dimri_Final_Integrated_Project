<h2>Know about us!</h2>
<p>We are two pahad (mountain in English) loving people from a small valley in India. We come from the mountains and thus our love for where we belong. There's nothing in the world that makes us feel more like home than these mountains. Along with that, we have thoughts that have crossed our minds at some point of time, something that connected with us differently and something we have kept close to ourselves. Living in the hills is an everyday adventure and a privilege ( as we believe ). </p>
<br>
<h3>What this is all about?</h3>
<p>So this blog is all about the peace, the happiness, the clarity of mind and the adventure that comes with being a pahadi (a person who belongs to the mountains)! 
Follow up through writeups that came to us because of the peace that the hills gave and pictures of the mountains from where we belong, or as we like to call it, "Myero" meaning ours.
